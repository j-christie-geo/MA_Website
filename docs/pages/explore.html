                        The Montserrat Volcano Observatory (MVO) was established shortly after the first phreatic eruption of the Soufrière Hills Volcano on July 18th 1995. Since then, the MVO monitors and provides advice about the activity of Soufrière Hills to the Government of Montserrat. Collected monitoring data is published in a Weekly Activity Report, and forms the basis for an annual formal risk assessment, produced by the MVO and the Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC).
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The MVO is also responsible for outreach related to the Soufrière Hills Volcano, including public meetings, work with schools and communities, local radio broadcasting, and national and international media enquiries.
                        The Observatory is staffed by scientists from a variety of organisations working with local personnel. The scientific teams come mainly from the Seismic Research Unit (SRU) of the University of the West Indies in Trinidad and the British Geological Survey (BGS).

                        The deformation of the surface of the Earth reflects the processes happening at depth. Methods such as GPS (Global Positioning System) or EDM (Electronic Density Measurement) can measure small displacements of the surface, for example along faults before and after an earthquake, or even of entire tectonic plates. GPS and EDM are also used to monitor the change of shape of volcanoes, for example if their surface bulges or deflates, giving an indication of magma movements within the crust.

                        Electronic Distances Measurement (EDM) instruments emit beams of infrared light which is reflected by a prism or target on the volcano. Because the speed of the light beams is known, the distance to the target can be measured very precisely.

                        As magma makes its way to the surface, the pressure lowers, causing it to degas: Gas bubbles form and want to occupy more space at the magma continues to rise. They also often want to rise more quickly than the magma. All of this creates forces in the magma body, which can change how it erupts. Different types of gas leave the magma at different times or depths. Thus, detecting the amount and types of gas gives us vital clues about the inside of the volcano we cannot see.

                        Fumaroles are openings in the ground which emit volcanic gases like carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and water vapour escape. They are common near the active vent of a volcano (crater and/or dome), but they can often also be found further away on the flanks of volcanoes. Changes in the temperature and composition of fumaroles are an important indicator for processes in the volcano's interior, therefore it is important to monitor and regularly sample them.

                        Seismometers can detect different types of small earthquakes within the volcano, which can tell us something about how magma moves in the interior of the volcano. In that sense, seismometers help us 'see' inside the volcano.

                        Seismometers can help us pick up characteristics of earthquakes that are so small people can't even feel them. However, at several points during the 20th century, volcanic earthquakes on Montserrat were so strong that they destroyed buildings. And in the early stages of the eruption in 1995 and 1996, earthquakes frequently shook the island, as described in the Song 'Seismicity' by Zunky N'Dem.

                        Photography is one of the tools scientists use to monitor activity at lava domes. Photos taken with 'normal' cameras are useful to study changes in the shape of the dome and monitor growth when it is erupting. In addition, special infra-red cameras are used  to study temperatures on the surface of the dome and monitor the circulation of hot fluids.

                        This photo of the dome shows an infra-red image of the same area as the previous photo. Infra-red photography helps to 'see' the dome through vapour and gas and record temperatures on the surface of the dome.  Red colours designate areas with high temperatures and blue colours are colder. The photo shows that hydrothermal (hot and gas rich) fluids still circulate in and around the dome.

                        As lava is extruded, the shape of the lava dome constantly changes. By monitoring such changes in dome morphology, we can study how and how fast lava is extruded. This is important because rapid dome growth increases the likelihood of dome instabilities and collapse, which forms hazardous pyroclastic flows.

                        Changes in ash composition can give us important clues about the activity of volcanoes. The thickness of the deposit and type of ash also provides information about the size and style of an eruption. It is also important to ensure the ash is not hazardous to health. That's why, at times when everyone on island was struggling to rid their homes of ash, scientists regularly went out and collected ash samples to analyse their composition.

                        Crystals form in the magma as it rises through the crust and begins to cool. As they crystallise, the tiny crystals continuously record information about the magma, like its composition or temperature. This means that the crystals and textures of the rock provide frozen snapshots of the processes that have happened deep inside the volcano. Once erupted, we can study them in the field and in the laboratory to unravel some of these processes. This way, we can piece together the story of why and how the magma erupted.

                        Different types of magma interact deep in the crust and they are often brought up together. The black round pieces in the otherwise white rock in this photograph are called 'mafic enclaves' - they come from a hot magma deep in the crust, which encountered another magma body (white) on its way to the surface.

                        One of the most common types of crystals in the Soufrière Hills rocks are feldspars. They form white or transparent laths up to a few millimeter length. Under the microscope they often look stripy, as shown in this illustration. Feldspars are particularly useful to reconstruct magma processes.

                        Another common type of crystal in the Soufrière Hills rocks is amphibole. It is usually easy to spot because of its prismatic shape. In the rocks, it will look black, but under the microscope they are often yellow or green. Note: The crystals don't really have eyes and mouths.

                        Seismometers can pick up signals of rockfalls, mudflows or pyroclastic flows as they move down the volcano. Rockfalls, mudflows and pyroclastic flows each produce a distinct pattern of waves on the seismometer. We can use these traces to detect when falls and flows happen, even if we can't see them.

                        Pyroclastic flows are hot mixtures of gasses and tephra (volcanic rocks of micrometers to meters in size) that travel down volcanic flanks at high speeds of more than 100 km/h. At Soufrière Hills, pyroclastic flows typically form when the growing dome becomes instable and collapses. Large Vulcanian explosions in 1997 also produced pyroclastic flows when the eruption column lost momentum and collapsed.

                        Volcanoes like Soufrière Hills produce lots of volcanic ash when they erupt. That's why the summits of many volcanoes are covered by a thick layer of ash. Rainfall can remobilise this ash to form so-called mudflows or lahars. This are mixtures of water, ash and other volcanic debris, running down the volcanoes following river channels and destroying everything in their path.

                        The materials coming from the volcano change the landscape, sometimes rapidly, sometimes slowly. There are many types of flow, the one most talked about was the pyroclastic flows but lahars ( flows mixtures of loose volcanic material and water) and surges (the violent and fast-moving part of the hot volcanic flows) also changed the landscape.

                        misting like a ganja sacrifice<br>
                        and the smoking of a prayer.<br>
                        Cattle back was a cultural centre<br>
                        for the white egret, its verandah theatre<br>
                        under the stars - spot to socializeand be refreshed. <br>
                        When combing cattlefor tick, an hardly altruistic act,<br>
                        this was the place to pause.<br>
                        The sideshow was a peaceful contrast<br>
                        while it lasted; not just white on red,<br>
                        big bearing small, but an object lesson<br>
                        in coexistence at the instep of a mountain<br>
                        which holds a land in thrall.<br>
                        Tonight chances pique still grows,
                        an unholy dome still glows,<br>
                        but cattle low and egrets ride<br>
                        in spite of fire from mountain tides.'</span> <br>

                        Scientists keep a constant eye on the state of activity of Soufrière Hills volcano with a wide range of techniques. Depending on the volcano's state of unrest, different volcano alert levels are assigned and communicated to the public. Each alert level comes with a set of predefined mandatory actions, such as access restrictions to certain parts of the island, or evacuations.

                        The eruption of Soufrière Hills Volcano started on 18 July 1995. The early days of the eruption where characterised by relatively small, phreatic eruptions driven by steam fracturing and exploding parts of the volcano. A lot of people got in their cars and tried to leave in a hurry when those early explosions happened.

                        The first really big explosion of the eruption took place more than a year later, on 17th September 1996. The song 'This Is It' by Zunky N'Dem is about this big explosion, which incidentally happened exactly seven years after Hurricane Hugo created widespread damage on island ('the seventh anniversary of Hugo').

                    <p class="exhibit-text-exp">Sirens were a common and powerful feature of the soundscape of Montserrat during the eruption. These sirens were used to warn residents in some areas - like Salem, Old Towne, Olveston, and Isles Bay - of potentially dangerous conditions related to pyroclsatic flows and ash fall. When this happened, residents were advised to evacuate. <br><br> 
                        In fact, these sirens are still used today. Have you noticed the musical chimes that echo around the island at midday everyday? This is coming from the sirens. The siren system is kept active because there is a possibility the volcano may become more active again, but also because they are used for warning about other hazards, particularly hurricanes. </p>

                            "I cannot forget the sirens, how can I forget. When there's an eruption you have the sirens that will sound to say: 'evacuate, evacuate now'. That in itself is really something, you get goose bumps each time you hear this 'evacuate, evacuate now'. You know it's serious [...] If you didn't have a vehicle they would send a bus to collect people. "

                    <p class="exhibit-text-exp">The early days of the eruption were very challenging. The volcano had not erupted for hundreds of years and there was a lot of uncertainty about what the volcano might do. Residents in the south of the island near to the volcano were evacuated. 
                        However, life is difficult when you have been evacuated and you are living in a shelter - it's hard to make a living and the economy suffers. For a time, because the eruption was quite slow to build up, people were allowed to return to their homes. Unfortunately, when the volcano was more active, people were evacuated again - people did a lot of to-and-fro or back and forth. <br><br>

                        Volcanic activity increased throughout 1996, and in response, towns and villages in the south of the island were evacuated.   
                        A year later, on Boxing Day 1997, the collapse of the southern crater wall of Soufrière Hills Volcano ('Galway's Wall') caused a lateral blast that removed the evacuated villages of southwest Montserrat overnight. 
                        The song 'South Gone' commemorates this moment.

                        Explosions of Soufrière Hills Volcano became more violent through 1996 and 1997, and as a result the South of the island became gradually uninhabitable. Montserratians were forced to leave their homes or shelters and evacuate to safer parts of the island. As volcanic activity increased, they often had to relocate several times, causing persistent loss and hardship for the islanders. The song below, 'One More River to Cross', by Cupid, describes the experience of moving and crossing over river after river on the way north. The song is a powerful reminder of the emotional strain and frustration that Montserratians experienced during this time, as well as their resilience.

                            "I can remember sometimes during the eruption, you did not focus as you normally would have been focusing before the eruption. For me, I was thinking what next, ‘cause they used to have some songs like One More River to Cross, they used to have some different alerts, red alert, amber alert, next stage of the volcano, so there are times you keep thinking about what is going to happen next so you were a bit uncomfortable. Really uncomfortable. The volcanologist would come on the radio and they would speak about how the volcano is erupting and its different stages, so I myself was rather concerned about what would happen, where do we go if we have to relocate again from one point to another? At one time they said Salem have to relocate, Nantes River, that was close-by, Rams I think, and you keep asking yourself questions. Well if we have to be relocating from one place to a next, one place to a next, where else do we have to go?"

Not only the loss of one's home and livelihood, but a complete change to one's way of life. Shelters were very hard places to live, with very limited privacy or facilities.

So it was like in and out, ups and downs, and sometimes when we come back to the north we have to change places where we were staying, so we were not staying at one location every time we leave from the unsafe zone, so to speak. We had different places that they would put us. We had a place which is Shiloh Pentecostal Church, now Deliverance. We had to stay in that one, we stayed in Rocklands, we stayed in Brades, shelters down where they have the water plant now in Brades, and the Plymouth Nuts, those buildings were shelters, some galvanised buildings, and they had the kitchens at the back of those buildings and everybody had to be using the kitchen so when two  persons in the kitchen at one time, another two persons have to wait, they would have to take out their pot or their food and take it inside the building.

                        The volcanic crisis deepened political and social tensions. By summer 1997, the capital Plymouth and other towns in the south and central island had been evacuated.  As activity of Soufrière Hills Volcano further exacerbated in August 1997 and parts of Plymouth were buried by pyroclastic flows, the UK government offered the 4000 remaining islanders a "voluntary evacuation package". But Montserratians widely refused the offer amidst confusion where they would be evacuated to and fears that the financial support was not enough to start a new life.

                        By August 1997, two thirds of the island had become uninhabitable, and scientists voiced concerns that volcanic activity might soon also threaten the "Safe Zone" in the North. Some 7000 Montserratians had already left the island, but the remaining islanders were not inclined to take up Clare Short (then UK's Secretary for International Development) on her offer of a relocation package:

                        Montserratians believed that the UK government did not offer a clear and fair relief plan, and that the Montserratian government, headed by the newly appointed Chief Minister David Brandt, did not fight enough for better terms. They voiced their frustration and distrust in the authorities with protests, but also in songs and poetry.In addition to politicians in Montserrat and Westminster, the song 'What Next' by Pop Morris also mentions MVO scientists Simon Young and Steve Sparks, who were at the helm of communicating the exacerbation of volcanic activity.

                        This song, Refugee, portrays the difficulties some islanders encountered when they were forced to leave their homes in the south, and move to the North. The lyrics reflect the confusion and frustration of being a refugee in one's own country, and the challenges of adjusting to life in a new area.

Almost every few weeks we would lose one of them. It was very sad, because they were very nice old people. But on the flip side of that, we had some fantastic time talking with them, getting all the old stories, hearing where they all grew up and, we learned a lot from them, in those last days, so it was beneficial for us, the younger people, because if it wasn’t for the volcano, I would not have been talking to elderly people from St Johns and Harris’ and Long Ground, I would have been speaking to older people from St Patricks, like my grandparents, but we got a chance to mingle with all of the old people from across the island"

                        For those that remained on the island, songs and poetry was an important way to express their resilience and fortitude in the face of hardship. In this song, Pops Morris appreciates the people who did not leave the island, staying to preserve the culture and community.

                            'Looking back on past events of this country<br>
                            Pirates came to evacuate Emerald city<br>
                            They want to rob the tranquility, the peace, the beauty<br>
                            They thought we would run and leave our homes and property<br>
                            But with much resilience we forced them to surrender<br>
                            So we could restore joy and pride all over<br>
                            So let’s recognise<br>
                            The man and the son<br>
                            Who stayed to keep this country alive<br><br>
                            Tell them thank you / For holding on<br>
                            Thank you / Oh for braving the storm<br><br>
                            When mountains crumbled we stood the test of times<br>
                            When darkness came we kept hope alive<br>
                            Those very cold nights that we squeezed side by side<br>
                            When heavy ash fall we cried Lord have mercy<br>
                            Send us rain, Lord, this ash is killing me<br>
                            But in everything though, we must all be thankful<br><br>
                            Now turn to your sister let mea hear you say: thank you<br>
                            Turn  to our brother let me hear you say: thank you<br>
                            It’s time we show our people how much we appreciate them<br><br>
                            Some people I know deserve special credit,<br>
                            They left their homes thinking one day they will return<br>
                            All they worked for either got buried or burnt<br>
                            Not an easy thing no to lose all you earned.<br>
                            And still survive living the rough shelter life<br>
                            Strong faith and will brought us through the fight<br>
                            Give a national day, for they are heroes<br>
                            One day alive please give them them the word'

                        Even in the shadow of the volcano and its ash, Montserratians have found ways to live and to embrace their island and its beauty. The eruption has changed the landscape and society, but it has not diminished the love for Montserrat.

                            "I was living in the east then, and everybody used to just come to Plymouth to sit under the evergreen tree to see what the ash looks like. Tiny little flakes dropping on you, you thought it was cool, but we never knew how dangerous it was gonna turn out to be. But for us it was like an excitement, at first, experience something you never experienced. Hearing the rumbling like a jet plane and tiny little flakes. If you wear white, that would be all destroyed 'cause you couldn’t get the ash from out of it, but we didn’t mind. [...] everyone used to come from the country, the people in the surrounding areas used to stay where they are but we used to come from the north, from the south, from the east, ‘cause we wanted to be in Plymouth ‘cause that’s where most of the ash was falling."

                        When the volcano was very active, like when there were large explosions or dome collapses, ashfall could be particularly heavy. The large dome collapse in July 2003 was a particularly bad case, with 15 cm of ash falling in Old Towne. Ash blanketing the landscape looks quite like snow, but it realy is nothing like it. It doesn't melt and it gets everywhere and makes life very difficult.

                        Ash is made up of tiny fragments of rock that are created when lava is ripped apart in an eruption. It forms dense clouds, but unlike normal clouads which are made of water which lets light through, ash blocks out the light. There are many accounts of how the ash clouds from the volcano would turn day to night, block out the sun, and prevent people from being able to see their hand stretched out in front of them.

So we stayed put, and waited to the morning to see what was going on, because at this point there was no electricity so we couldn’t tell what was going on - it was really eery. After a while we started smelling the smell of burnt material, it smelt as if the house was actually burning and we were seeing what looked like smoke in the house. So we were looking around the house to see if something in the house was burning. But when I looked outside into the ghaut below, I thought, I’ve never seen a cloud that low in the ghaut before."

                        The only way to clear up the ash that fell on roofs and roads was to shovel it up. This was a daily task for many Montserratians, and it was not an easy one. The ash was heavy, and the shovelling was hard work. But it was necessary to keep the island functioning. Here what this Montserrat resiedent has to say about it:

                        Ash - this fine pulverised lava dust - is so fine that it is carried in the air, blown by the wind, kicked up by passing cars or even under foot. It can get into car engines, into computers, into clothes, and into lungs if care is not taken. It's a significant hazard and a real nuissance. No matter what you do, ash will be there. Here we hear from some Montserratians about their experience of ash:

                        On 12-13 July 2003, the largest ever historical dome collapse removed the entire dome of Soufrière Hills Volcano, and ash blanketed both the north and the south of the island, due to an unusual prevailing winds (usually the north part of the island is not affected). Up to 15 cm of ash were deposited. A major clean-up operation across the island was carried out, which brought short-term financial relief for Montserratians.

                        Vulcanian explosions do not only produce fine ash, but they can also send larger blocks of pumice and dome rocks flying short distances. This was a particular concern on the small island of Montserrat, as told by this resident.

                        The island of Montserrat is located in the Lesser Antilles Volcanic Arc. All of these well-known Caribbean islands are of volcanic origin: The subduction of the Atlantic tectonic plate beneath the Caribbean plate produces water-rich, bouyant magma that rises to the surface and erupts. Volcanoes form and grow over time, first beneath the sea level, then above, eventually forming the islands of the Lesser Antilles.

                        Montserrat has gradually grown in this way over the last ~2.2 million years. Repeated volcanic eruptions have built the land layer by layer, pyroclastic flow by pyroclastic flow. Through time, the focus of volcanic activity has moved from the north to the south of the island. First, the Silver Hills started to emerge from the sea, with volcanic activity occurring here for more than a million years. Roughly 1 million years ago, volcanic activity in the Centre Hills began and lasted for ~700,000 years. As the focus of volcanism continued to move southwards, Centre Hills stopped erupting and activity at Soufrière Hills and South Soufrière Hills commenced ~450,000 years ago. Currently, Soufrière Hills is the only active volcanic centre on Montserrat.

                        On 8 February 1843, a large earthquake struck the islands of the Lesser Antilles. Like the volcanism that built the islands, this earthquake was related to the subduction of the Atlantic tectonic plate beneath the Caribbean plate. Its epicentre was beneath Montserrat's southern neighbour island Guadeloupe and had an estimated magnitude of 8.5. The earthquake caused severe damage and six fatalities on Montserrat. The despatch of Edward Baynes (Chancellor and Vice-Admiral of Montserrat) describes the earthquake and the extent of damage on island:

This has been occasioned by land slips, and the falling of cliffs impending over them. The disruption of these immense masses  [...] raised a dense cloud of dust, resembling smoke, which overspread the whole country, elevating itself above the summits of the mountains, and must have presented an alarming appearance from the sea. [...] The shock commenced at 10 A.M., proceeding with an undulatory motion, apparently from east to west: its duration was about two minutes; an unusual space of time for a single shock, which this seemed to be."

                        From 1897 to 1900, a series of volcano-tectonic earthquakes rocked Montserrat island, which destroyed several buildings and were accompanied by gas emissions. This unrest was likely related to magma moving in the shallow subsurface and almost reaching the surface. An article in the Montserrat Herald on 20 October 1900 describes one of the earthquakes:

M. two heavy shocks followed within a few seconds of each other. No injury to life and limb. The injuries to properties have been mostly the same that suffered in 1898. The windmill tower at Gage's is rent at the base; Paradise chimney cut; Tar River boiling-house wall, windmill tower, and chimney wrecked; the wall of St. George's Church which is being restored is rent in all directions, and the belfry, which was a beauty, cut off.”

Similar unrest periods occurred at conspicuous 30-year intervals in 1933-1937, 1966-1967 and 1992-1995, before Soufrière Hills started erupting in 1995.

Comparisons were often made between islands (in this case between St Vincent impacted by a hurricane in 1898) and Montserrat's 1899 devastation, and things became complex when islands were multiply impacted by the same event.

                        Soufrière Hills Volcano showed renewed signs of unrest in the 1930s, with repeated earthquakes causing damage and increased fumarole activity. During the seismic swarms, the Agricultural Station on Montserrat made detailed notes on the type of earthquakes occurring. Although they did not have seismometers at this time they made a distinction between several types of earthquake including: tremors; double tremors; shocks and severe shocks. A compilation of the written accounts in the UK National Archive illustrates the pattern of seismicity in 1934 and 1935.

                        American inventor and volcanologist Frank Perret visited the island 12 times between 1934 and 1937. In his report on the unrest, he notes the strong resemblance of the events to the unrest in 1897-1900:

                        Perret's detailed account of the 1930s unrest provide useful context for present-day activity of Soufrière Hills. However, at the time, Perret's presence on island and his role during the seismic crisis was seen critically by the Admiralty, to put it mildly. They accused him of being a fear-mongering "pseudo scientist" causing "unneccesary expense to the crown":

                        Montserratians, on the other hand, seemed to hold Perret in high esteem. Frustrated by the lack of action in the face of the unrest, several members of Montserrat's community wrote directly to the 'Secretary of State for the Colonies', citing Perret and petitioning for more scientific investigations:

Then you go up the road and no one [had a roof]… so as kids, we start travelling around the street, looking around, and we saw that the whole area, everybody has lost their roof, whose house hasn’t been blown away was left shelter-less and took us maybe a week and everybody start putting on just one roof, and we stayed together, everybody eat the same thing, we go to the stream and we wash our clothing, before we actually got help.

And he used to come to the workshops and he usually did say the volcano is boiling like a boiled … and we would laugh. We would laugh after him, but he spent more time in that valley than most of us did, so he actually knew what was going on, when we did … the thing is, with nature you have to pay attention and you have to listen to her, and she was sending a message but most of us were deaf to what she was saying. But this guy was actually here and he was saying, ‘he is bawling like a bull’ and we were saying he’s talking nonsense, but he was right."

So the truck couldn’t go down.  ‘cause once it go down it wouldn’t be coming back because the road drop. And it dropped so far that you would leave the truck hanging. And that’s when everybody was start to worrying about whether it was sinking or what was going on, and then it was like the talk, people start talking."

I don’t understand what I’m hearing.’ And then he left and he went back the afternoon, they normally go up twice in the day just to look for the animals. When he came back the evening, he said, ‘The sound is getting more and more.’ And then one morning he went up and he said he heard this thing like a jumbo jet, the sound that he said he’s hearing is the sound like … he remember when the Pan Am jet had crashed at Chances Peak.

                        However, in October 1996, the south wall of Soufrière Hills' crater ('Galway's Wall') looming behind the hot springs started showing fractures and other signs of instability. The growing lava dome gradually overtopped the crater rim and destabilised it. This was a major concern for MVO scientists.

                        In August 1997, a series of 10 Vulcanian explosions generated ash and pyroclastic flows that buried parts of Plymouth, which by that time had been permanently evacuated. Activity continued at a high level in September and October 1997 with a further 75 medium-sized Vulcanian eruptions.

                        On 20 May 2006, there was an intense tropical storm that generated mudflows. Later that same day, there was a very large collapse of the entire dome. The debris from this large event was then rapidly re-distributed in the Belham Valley during rainfall over the next year or so, as shown by the time series of a house in Belham Valley.

                        Volcanologists widely consider this dome collapse the end of the eruptive cycle that started in 1995. However, since then, Soufrière Hills has had two phases of vigorous ash venting and small explosions, in March 2014 and March 2016, and the lava dome still shows active degassing today.

                        This shows that the volcano is certainly not back to dormancy just yet, and therefore volcanologists at MVO keep a close eye on it at all times. As of July 2025, 30 years have passed since the start of the eruption and much of the island remains in an exclusion zone. The words of Darkman's song 'Volcano When You Gonna Stop' resonate here.

                        The eruption of Soufrière Hills Volcano caused much destruction for Montserrat, both physically and socially. Indeed, many people had to start all over again - new places, new homes, new lives. However, the culture of the island and the essence of being Montserratian lives on within the people who chose to stay.  Hear from some Montserratians about how the experienced has shaped how they feel and the positives that have come from the eruption.

                        Plymouth was a vibrant and beautiful town - it was the centre of life on Montserrat. Most people worked here, and lived in the town or the neighbourhoods close by, like Kinsale, Cork Hill and Richmond Hill. Unfortunately, it was built in the shadow of the volcano and had to be abandoned. Over the last thirty years it has been buried by the debris left behind by pyroclastic flows and lahars. These pictures capture some of the changes that have happened in Plymouth.

                        The War Memorial and Clocktower commemorates Montserratians who died in World Wars I and II. As pyroclastic flows entered Plymouth in August 1997, the memorial was covered by ash and rocks. Since then, heavy rainfalls remobilised pyroclastic deposits and gradually buried the war memorial.

                        The Belham Valley drains into the Caribbean Sea south of Salem on the west side of the island. Prior to the eruption, it hosted the island's only golf course. As the eruption unfolded, several pyroclastic flows and more than 300 lahars have travelled down the valley and gradually buried it. These pictures capture some of these changes.

                        The Belham River Valley mouth in November 2006. After a large dome collapse in May earlier that year, many lahars travelled down the valley during the rainy season. As a result, former Old Road Bay is now filled with pyroclastic material, and the coastline has moved hundreds of meters west.

                        Prior to the Soufrière Hills eruption, Montserrat had international airport named after Chief Minister William Henry Bramble. Early activity of the volcano had not affected Bramble airport, but the collapse of the northern dome on 25 June 1997 produced pyroclastic flows towards the north, which reached the airport.

                        Trants was a small village on the east coast, built amidst the ruins of a prehistoric Amerindian settlement. The expanse of the land favoured growth of sugar cane, cotton and limes, and Bramble airport was located in close vicinity. Pyroclastic flows and lahars began descending the northeast flank of Soufrière Hills volcano in 1997, dramatically changing the landscape around Trants.

                        Carr's Bay and Little Bay in the northwest of the island used to be calm and sparsely populated. But as Plymouth was destroyed and abandoned in 1997, Brades became the de-facto capital of the island, which brought a huge boost to the region: Government buildings were built in Brades and Little Bay Marina was developed.
